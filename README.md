**MultiQC is a tool to aggregate bioinformatics results across many
samples into a single report.**

This repository contains files to test MultiQC with. These are used in the
automated [Travis CI build tests](https://travis-ci.org/ewels/MultiQC)
and can be used whilst developing for MultiQC.

Instead of cloning this repository directly, it is recommended that you
clone the main MultiQC repo recursively, which contains this repo as a
submodule.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC.git
```
